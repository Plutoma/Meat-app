'ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between the\nU.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia\'s exporting\nnations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic\ndamage, businessmen and officials said.\n    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\nMove against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\nU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.\n    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt\nthem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo\'s loss might be\ntheir gain.\n    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on\nimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in\nretaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to stick to a pact not\nto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.\n    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs\nat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms\nsaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the\nnew taxes.\n    \"We wouldn\'t be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for\nleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric\nIndustrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.\n    \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time\nbeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of\nexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom\nMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James\nCapel and Co>.\n    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.\n    \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against\nJapan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior\nTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.\n    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last\nyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S.\n    The surplus helped swell Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves\nto 53 billion dlrs, among the world\'s largest.\n    \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and\ncut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we\nwant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said\nPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.\n    A senior official of South Korea\'s trade promotion\nassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan\nmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports\nare similar to those of Japan.\n    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion\ndlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.\n    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough\ncurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of\nsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the\nU.S.\n    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been\nselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics\nmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such\na short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\nfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.\n    \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,\ndirector-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\n    \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\nbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong\nis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.\n    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\'s biggest export market,\naccounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\n    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\ntalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\nIndustry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\n    \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\ncountries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\nserious matter,\" Button said.\n    He said Australia\'s concerns centred on coal and beef,\nAustralia\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significant\nU.S. Exports to that country.\n    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\ntrade stand-off continue.\n    Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\na package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\n    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\nand record public works spending in the first half of the\nfinancial year.\n    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency\nmeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone\'s avowed fiscal reform program.\n    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto\nKuroda, Japan\'s deputy minister of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an\neffort to end the dispute.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS The Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand\noutlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese\nenergy demand, ministry officials said.\n    MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy\nsupplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600\nmln, they said.\n    The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in\nJapanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen\nand a decline in domestic electric power demand.\n    MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand\noutlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the\nAgency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.\n    They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy\nsupply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.\n    Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan\'s electric power\nin the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27\npct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and\nliquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Thailand\'s improved business climate this\nyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials\nand semi-finished products.\n    The country\'s oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the\nfirst quarter due to lower oil prices.\n    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6\nbillion baht from 56.6 billion.\n    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower\nearnings from many key commodities including rice whose\nearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26\npct and canned pineapples seven pct.\n    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up\n64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.\n REUTER\n&#3;',1

'INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is\nlikely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and\npossibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian\nNainggolan said.\n    He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in\npalm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.\n    Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil\nmay also be introduced. But he said the question was still\nbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no\ndecision on when to go ahead had been made.\n    The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber\nphysicals on an open outcry system four days a week.\n    \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said.\n\"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a\nmistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"\n    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee\nadded in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to\nfive months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are\ntraded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,\nexchange officials said.\n    The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the\nintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one\nofficial said a feasibility study was needed first. No\ndecisions are likely until after Indonesia\'s elections on April\n23, traders said.\n    Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the\nworld\'s second largest producer of natural rubber, should\nexpand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of\nthe exchange would help this.\n    Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost\noverseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.\n    He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to\nencourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would\nalso visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to\nencourage participation.\n    Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start\nalthough trading in coffee has been disappointing.\n    Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in\nApril 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9\nmln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered\nlocally, the latest exchange report said.\n     Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905\ntonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.\n     Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and\n44 traders.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to\nlose its status as Japan\'s most profitable bank as a result of\nits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.\n    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9\ntrillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank\nwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in\nOctober.\n    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu\ntold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its\nposition.\n    \"We\'ll be back in position in first place within three\nyears,\" Komatsu said in an interview.\n    He said that while the merger will initially reduce\nSumitomo\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand\nSumitomo\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where\nit has been relatively weak.\n    But financial analysts are divided on whether and how\nquickly the gamble will pay off.\n    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in\nview of the smaller bank\'s large debts. Others argue the merger\nwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\nnetwork from scratch.\n    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\nexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\nand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\nwisdom of some of those moves.\n    \"They\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\nit\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\nfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\n    Among Sumitomo\'s problems are limits placed on its move to\nenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\ninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\npct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\nleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\npersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n    \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\nFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n    \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\nwe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\nyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\ninto the securities business at home.\n    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\'s\nversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\nfrom investment banking.\n    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\nsaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\nopportunities.\n    \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\ncases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\nbank related. That\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\ndomestic securities business as profitable government bond\ndealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\nLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\nthe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\nsubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\nsecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\nfollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\nuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\ndecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n    \"We don\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\nin two or three years,\" he said.\n    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\nlending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\nreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\ntime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\nmerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n    \"It\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\nKleinwort\'s Smithson.\n    \"After that, it\'s a question of absorbing and juggling\naround. It will be the next decade before we see if the\nstrategy is right or wrong.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1\nbillion marks at today\'s tender for a 28-day securities\nrepurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank\nspokesman said.\n    Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,\nwill be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy\nback securities pledged on May 6.\n    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as\nan earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively\nwithdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with\ntoday\'s allocation.\n    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the\nwithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit\npolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful\nliquidity in the banking system.\n    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank\nover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely\nApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.\n    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2\nbillion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks\nthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.\n    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much\nliquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the\neffectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main\nopen-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two\nfurther pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.\n    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6\nand 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that\nrange are possible, dealers said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING Australian markets are booming as foreign\nfund managers redirect capital away from the United States and\nother traditional markets, analysts said.\n    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\nan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\nfresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and\nU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\nand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they\ndiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.\n    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\nthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\ncurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\n    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\nare not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\ninquiries from Japan and the United States.\n    \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\nand they don\'t know what to do with it. Some of that is ending\nup here with the attraction of high interest rates and\nreasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd\neconomist Brian Hamley said.\n    \"There is a \'flight to quality\',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may\nnot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren\'t too\nmany other countries where you\'d want to put your money.\"\n    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\ninvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\nthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n    \"We\'re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\nWhere some people would be concerned about the value of the\nU.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\nsaid. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\nand the currency looks stable?\"\n    But turning that capital into more permanent productive\ninvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n    \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\ndirection in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore\ninvestors would carefully watch the government\'s promised tough\neconomic statement on May 14.\n    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\ninterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\neasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\nbadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\nand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n    \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\ndelivered, if the statement wasn\'t considered tough enough, one\nmight see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.\n    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\neconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\nstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n    \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\nthey would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.\n    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\ninterest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\nJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\nelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\npolicy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\nthe yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\n    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\nsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\nwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\nAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\ntrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\nAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other\nmarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\nweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\nequities, particularly in the gold sector.\n    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\ntoday, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\nthe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\nsame period.\n    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese\ncompanies that have invested heavily in the United States in\nrecent years turning their attention to undervalued real\nestate, particularly in the tourism field.\n    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney\'s five-star\nRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\nas indicative of the type of property being sought.\n    \"They think they find good value real estate here which,\nwith long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\ninvestment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0
'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY Kuwait\'s oil-reliant and debt-ridden\neconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices\nwill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists\nsay.\n    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold\noil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the\nnorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.\n    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross\ndomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year\nafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.\n    This was after taking into account inflation in consumer\nprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.\n    Factors depressing economic activity include the\n6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s doorstep, which\nthreatens the emirate\'s vital oil export lifeline through the\nGulf and has sapped business confidence.\n    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September\nwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis\ncaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive\nnew debt settlement program was introduced.\n    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward\ntrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.\n    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer\nspending, thus generating an informal credit system.\n    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are\nstill owed by individuals and companies.\n    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)\nin outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which\none-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as\nbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it\nwill not allow any banks to go under.\n    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\nproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\ndebtors have regular cash flows or not.\n    Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\nguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\nin a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\nis the biggest after oil.\n    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\nout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\ncompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\nyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\nEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\nhome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\nover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\nproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\ncrude.\n    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\nfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\ninflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\nyears and signs government spending on productive sectors will\nremain steady.\n    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\nbillion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\nthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\nGulf.\n    Kuwait\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\nofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\nof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\nreserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for\nthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\n    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\nrevenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\ndoubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n    This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\nin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\nup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\nshortfall.\n    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\neconomic growth this year or next.\n    \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is\nimportant.\"\n    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\nthe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\nspending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\neconomy.\n    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\nspelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0
